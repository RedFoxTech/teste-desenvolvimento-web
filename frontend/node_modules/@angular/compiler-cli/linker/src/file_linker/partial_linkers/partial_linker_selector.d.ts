/**
 * A helper that selects the appropriate `PartialLinker` for a given declaration.
 *
 * The selection is made from a database of linker instances, chosen if their given semver range
 * satisfies the version found in the code to be linked.
 *
 * Note that the ranges are checked in order, and the first matching range will be selected, so
 * ranges should be most restrictive first.
 *
 * Also, ranges are matched to include "pre-releases", therefore if the range is `>=11.1.0-next.1`
 * then this includes `11.1.0-next.2` and also `12.0.0-next.1`.
 *
 * Finally, note that we always start with the current version (i.e. `11.2.13`). This
 * allows the linker to work on local builds effectively.
