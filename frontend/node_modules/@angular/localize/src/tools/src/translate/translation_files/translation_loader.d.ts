     *
     * For each locale to be translated, there is an element in `translationFilePaths`. Each element
     * is an array of absolute paths to translation files for that locale.
     * If the array contains more than one translation file, then the translations are merged.
     * If allowed by the `duplicateTranslation` property, when more than one translation has the same
     * message id, the message from the earlier translation file in the array is used.
     * For example, if the files are `[app.xlf, lib-1.xlf, lib-2.xlif]` then a message that appears in
     * `app.xlf` will override the same message in `lib-1.xlf` or `lib-2.xlf`.
     *
     * @param translationFileLocales An array of locales for each of the translation files.
     *
     * If there is a locale provided in `translationFileLocales` then this is used rather than a
     * locale extracted from the file itself.
     * If there is neither a provided locale nor a locale parsed from the file, then an error is
     * thrown.
     * If there are both a provided locale and a locale parsed from the file, and they are not the
     * same, then a warning is reported.
