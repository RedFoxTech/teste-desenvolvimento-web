/**
 * A simple class that represents a date that datepicker also uses internally.
 *
 * It is the implementation of the `NgbDateStruct` interface that adds some convenience methods,
 * like `.equals()`, `.before()`, etc.
 *
 * All datepicker APIs consume `NgbDateStruct`, but return `NgbDate`.
 *
 * In many cases it is simpler to manipulate these objects together with
 * [`NgbCalendar`](#/components/datepicker/api#NgbCalendar) than native JS Dates.
 *
 * See the [date format overview](#/components/datepicker/overview#date-model) for more details.
 *
